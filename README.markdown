COMDASUAR Mk II
===============

An implementation for the Raspberry Pi of Jose Vicente Asuar's COMDASUAR
digital music computer.

INTRO
----------
In 1978 Chilean Computer Music Pioneer Jose Vicente Asuar built a sequencing
synthesizer for around $1000 similar systems at the time costed tens or
hundreds of thousands.
His machine also had some unique features, as it was designed as a
computer assisted composition tool for "traditional" western calssical
music.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The current system will run on a Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't require one.
It is written in python and uses Csound as the sound engine.
If an arduino is connected to the system, and it has the "Old Standard 
Firmata" firmware installed, the 6 analog inputs can control 6 parameters.
